This repository contains a sample **Node.js / TypeScript** application that demonstrates how to use [Tolling Vision](https://tollingvision.com) ‚Äî a Dockerized AI-powered service for tolling companies. Tolling Vision extracts valuable information from vehicle images or image sequences, including:

- **ANPR/ALPR** ‚Äì Automatic Number Plate Recognition  
- **MMR** ‚Äì Make and Model Recognition  
- **ADR** ‚Äì Dangerous Goods Sign Recognition

Tolling Vision is highly scalable and integrates easily into existing systems via **gRPC**. For integration guidance, visit the [How to use Tolling Vision](https://tollingvision.com/how-to-use-tolling-vision/) tutorial.

This sample specifically demonstrates usage of the `search` function of the `TollingVisionService`, ideal for simpler analysis workflows where a single image is used to detect a license plate and extract MMR information.
